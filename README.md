# TurnScape

Jeff is a very special breed of dog, the purebred, light-skinned Doggo. Because he is such a rare species, many poachers have sought to catch his kind and put them on display. Jeff, in particular, has been captured and is caged in a very intricate, futuristic maze. His captors even mock him by putting him into a hot dog costume.

You somehow get a hold of the futuristic maze, but it is very confusing and has special rules. Use your spatial skills to help Jeff escape his confinement and be free again!
